# work schema for search results

## search page
- fake search page (home) [need a fake logo, copy old google]
- js to generate search results on the fly (thinking just a query param swaps out contents)
- sometimes we only need a single result - gen three results for these
- resultss page
  - icon tl, search bar
  - results listed in some type w prespec'd classes
  - show (10 of ...)

## web4u page
- need a home page - splash screen (simple) - not sure what web4u looks like but i bet we can copy uw internal res9ources too (sub-canvas)
- student sheet - super simple :3 (just a table view - can def procgen that)
  - student numbers should be almost-completely random - no time period!!

## news page
- thinking of goinfg with a single format and changing around the content a  little bit to represent differewnt news sites
  - banner
  - tabs (world, us, economy, etc...) (can custom)
- sub-category for obit content - something generic.

## email
- copy gmail - lightweight, no need to interact
  - full view only - add tabs to side, # of many
